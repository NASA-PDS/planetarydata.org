# üìÄ IPDA Website Installation

Installing the IPDA web site software requires the following packages be available:

- Unix of some flavor
- Python_ 2.7 (plus development libraries and headers, ``python2.7-dev``)
- libjpeg_ (plus development libraries and headers, ``libjpeg62-dev``)
- PDF Poppler_ Utilities, ``poppler-utils``
- wvWare_ (also known as ``wv``)
- Lynx_
- Build tools: C/C++ compiler, make, etc. (like the ``build-essential`` package on some Unix distributions)

You'll also need a non-privileged user account to run the software. For the purposes of this document, we'll call this user $USER.

1.  Go to the installation directory (you should see the file `bootstrap.py` and the directory `src`, etc.).
2.  Copy `ops.cfg.in` to `ops.cfg` if it's not already there and edit it to put in some decent passwords.
3.  Bootstrap: `/usr/local/ipda/python2.7/bin/python2.7 bootstrap.py -c ops.cfg` if it's not already boostrapped. (üóí Note: it doesn't hurt to re-bootstrap.)
4.  Build out: `bin/buildout -c ops.cfg`

You can then start things via:
```console
bin/supervisord
```


## üêà Tomcat Upgrades

Tomcat upgrades are handled by the system administrators now. You no longer have to concern yourself.

<!--
1.  Edit the `etc/versions/dists.cfg` file and install a new URL (and MD5) for the desired Tomcat version.
2.  Run the following commands:

```console
bin/supervisorctl stop tomcat
bin/buildout -c ops.cfg install tomcat
bin/buildout -c ops.cfg install tomcat-conf
bin/buildout -c ops.cfg install tomcat-users
bin/buildout -c ops.cfg install tomcat-script
bin/buildout -c ops.cfg install registry-service
bin/buildout -c ops.cfg install registry-service-war
bin/buildout -v -c ops.cfg install registry-service-config
bin/supervisorctl start tomcat
```
-->
