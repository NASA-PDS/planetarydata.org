Installation
============

Use Buildout_ with the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe.

• Add ``ipdasite.policy`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        ipdasite.policy
        
• Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
  
    $ ./bin/buildout
        
That's it.
