ipdasite.policy
***************

This is the "policy" product for the Plone-based site of the International
Planetary Data Alliance (IPDA_).  Its job is to orchestrate the dependencies
and configure them in order to transform an ordinary Plone_ site into the IPDA
site.

It was developed by the Planetary Data System (PDS_).
