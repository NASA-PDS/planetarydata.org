This package provides a service registry for the International Planetary Data
Alliance (IPDA_).  It allows the general public to view service descriptions
registered with the IPDA service registry.  It also enables users who have
permissions to register new services and update existing services.

This registry implementation is targeted for compatibility with the service
registry deployed for the Planetary Data System (PDS_), which itself is based
on the ebXML_ notion of a registry (as specified by the `registry information
model`_).

Although intended for the IPDA web site, it can be deployed to any Plone_
based site (and is tested with Plone 4).
