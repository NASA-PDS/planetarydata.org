Changelog
=========

What follows is a history of changes from release to release, along with
issues addressed and new features in each release.


1.0.10 — Submit-A-Binding-Button
--------------------------------

Fixes https://oodt.jpl.nasa.gov/jira/browse/IPDA-50


1.0.9 — Submit-A-Tool-Button
----------------------------

This release adds a tool submission button to Service Registry view templates.
It also fixes the CSS for button styling on all the templates.


1.0.8 — Hmm, More Upgrades
--------------------------

This release simplifies the page templates for the various types.  It also
makes it compatible with Plone 4.3.


1.0.7 — Hmm, Upgrades
---------------------

This release makes the unit, functional, and integration tests use the
standard plone.app.testing layers and fixtures.  It also makes this release
compatible with Plone 4-latest (4.2.1 as of this writing).


1.0.6 — 1.2 Compatibility
-------------------------

Now compatible with PDS Registry Client 1.2.


1.0.5 — 4.1 Compatibility
-------------------------

Now compatible with Plone 4.1.


1.0.4 — Tools, Not Services
---------------------------

Wedging all the tools that IPDA registered into the ebXML Service Registry
model just confused users.  So, we keep the model, but downplay the "service"
aspect of it and instead call things "Tools".  Services have tool URLs now.


1.0.3 — That Is Not Logical
---------------------------

This release makes sure that logical IDs (or "lids") throughout the system are
kept unique.  This should help prevent a certain PDS engineer from re-using
the same lid "TBD" over and over, which is incompatible with the PDS Service
Registry.

Speaking of, this release also writes all of its data to a PDS Registry
Service.  Just set the "home" attribute of a Registry instance to the endpoint
URL of a PDS Service Registry and all of the service registrations
will be synchronized into the PDS Registry Service.

Note that this is *not* two-way synchronization.  Information pre-existing in
a PDS Registry Service will be wiped out by this package: services with the
same GUIDs will be overwritten in the PDS Registry Service, and any other
Services will be purged.  This package therefore uses a PDS Registry Services
solely as redundant backing store.


1.0.2 — More Fine Tuning
------------------------

This release adds the slot "interface type" to Services.  It also adds three
new categories (analysis, dissemination, and visualization).


1.0.1 — Slot Car Racing
-----------------------

This release implements additional ebXML-styled slots needed for the IPDA
release of the service registry, including:

* interface type (using a controlled vocabulary)
* description (but calling it "abstract" to avoid confusion with the Dublin
  Core "description")
* operating system (also using a controlled vocabulary)
* requirements
* curating source (institution, contact name, email address, telephone number)


1.0.0 — Initial Implementation
------------------------------

This is an initial release so PDS can try it out.


0.0.0 — Unreleased
------------------

There are no releases yet of ipdasite.services.
