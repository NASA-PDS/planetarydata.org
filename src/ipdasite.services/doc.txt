*****************
ipdasite.services
*****************

This package provides a service registry for the International Planetary Data
Alliance (IPDA_).  It allows the general public to view service descriptions
registered with the IPDA service registry.  It also enables users who have
permissions to register new services and update existing services.

This registry implementation is targeted for compatibility with the service
registry deployed for the Planetary Data System (PDS_), which itself is based
on the ebXML_ notion of a registry (as specified by the `registry information
model`_).

Although intended for the IPDA web site, it can be deployed to any Plone_
based site (and is tested with Plone 4).

Installation
============

Use Buildout_ with the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe.

* Add ``ipdasite.services`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        ipdasite.services
        
* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        ipdasite.services
        
* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
  
    $ ./bin/buildout
        
You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file, which you almost certainly are for
this package, since ``ipdasite.policy`` includes it as a dependency.

Changelog
=========

What follows is a history of changes from release to release, along with
issues addressed and new features in each release.


1.0.10 — Submit-A-Binding-Button
--------------------------------

Fixes https://oodt.jpl.nasa.gov/jira/browse/IPDA-50


1.0.9 — Submit-A-Tool-Button
----------------------------

This release adds a tool submission button to Service Registry view templates.
It also fixes the CSS for button styling on all the templates.


1.0.8 — Hmm, More Upgrades
--------------------------

This release simplifies the page templates for the various types.  It also
makes it compatible with Plone 4.3.


1.0.7 — Hmm, Upgrades
---------------------

This release makes the unit, functional, and integration tests use the
standard plone.app.testing layers and fixtures.  It also makes this release
compatible with Plone 4-latest (4.2.1 as of this writing).


1.0.6 — 1.2 Compatibility
-------------------------

Now compatible with PDS Registry Client 1.2.


1.0.5 — 4.1 Compatibility
-------------------------

Now compatible with Plone 4.1.


1.0.4 — Tools, Not Services
---------------------------

Wedging all the tools that IPDA registered into the ebXML Service Registry
model just confused users.  So, we keep the model, but downplay the "service"
aspect of it and instead call things "Tools".  Services have tool URLs now.


1.0.3 — That Is Not Logical
---------------------------

This release makes sure that logical IDs (or "lids") throughout the system are
kept unique.  This should help prevent a certain PDS engineer from re-using
the same lid "TBD" over and over, which is incompatible with the PDS Service
Registry.

Speaking of, this release also writes all of its data to a PDS Registry
Service.  Just set the "home" attribute of a Registry instance to the endpoint
URL of a PDS Service Registry and all of the service registrations
will be synchronized into the PDS Registry Service.

Note that this is *not* two-way synchronization.  Information pre-existing in
a PDS Registry Service will be wiped out by this package: services with the
same GUIDs will be overwritten in the PDS Registry Service, and any other
Services will be purged.  This package therefore uses a PDS Registry Services
solely as redundant backing store.


1.0.2 — More Fine Tuning
------------------------

This release adds the slot "interface type" to Services.  It also adds three
new categories (analysis, dissemination, and visualization).


1.0.1 — Slot Car Racing
-----------------------

This release implements additional ebXML-styled slots needed for the IPDA
release of the service registry, including:

* interface type (using a controlled vocabulary)
* description (but calling it "abstract" to avoid confusion with the Dublin
  Core "description")
* operating system (also using a controlled vocabulary)
* requirements
* curating source (institution, contact name, email address, telephone number)


1.0.0 — Initial Implementation
------------------------------

This is an initial release so PDS can try it out.


0.0.0 — Unreleased
------------------

There are no releases yet of ipdasite.services.
