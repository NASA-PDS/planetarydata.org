pds.registry
************

This is an implementation of the ebXML_ Registry information model and client
software, implemented for the NASA_ Planetary Data System (PDS_).

The PDS Registry_ provides tracking, auditing, locating, and maintaining
artifacts within PDS.  These artifacts can range from data files and label
files, schemas, dictionary definitions for objects and elements, services,
etc.

It was developed by the PDS Engineering Node (EN_), operated by JPL_.  See the
package's ``docs`` directory for more information, including installation
instructions, license, and history of changes.

Requirements
============

Python 2.6 or 2.7.  It is *not* compatible with Python 2.5 or earlier
versions, nor with Python 3 or later versions.


Installation
============

By far, the easiest way to install pds.registry is to use pip_ or
easy_install_.  As a privileged user, type::

    pip install pds.registry

or::

    easy_install pds.registry

The software as well as its dependencies will be downloaded and installed
automatically.  Of course, you can use it in virtualenvs_ and buildouts_ too.


Installing from Source
----------------------

If neither pip nor easy_install are available on your system, just install
from source:

1.  Download the source package archive.
2.  Extract the gzip'd tar archive.
3.  In the extracted directory, run ``python setup.py install`` as a
    privileged user.

Changelog
=========

What follows is a history of changes from release to release, along with
issues addressed and new features in each release.

1.8.1 - Associations
--------------------

* Added API to retrieve associations (PDS-342).


1.5.0 - Extrinsics
------------------

* Remove workaround for registry service emitting HTTP 500 for "not found"
  instead of 404.  (PDS-29)
* Add implementation for ExtrinsicObject in model and in net
* Replaced old "A and B or C" expressions with safer "B if A else C"
  expressions


1.2.0 - Version Updates
-----------------------

This release makes the client API compatible with the 1.2 release of the PDS
registry service.  In particular, it fixes the integration of the
Maven-provided project information with Python's Distribute-supplied project
metadata.


1.0.0 - Released
----------------

This release includes the following changes from the original 
unreleased release:

* The client now works with 1.0.0 of the Registry Service.
* Support for the ``versionID`` attribute in the RegistryObject class is
  dropped as the Registry Service no longer makes that a "user-visible"
  attribute.
