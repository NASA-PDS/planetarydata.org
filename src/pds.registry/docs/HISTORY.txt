Changelog
=========

What follows is a history of changes from release to release, along with
issues addressed and new features in each release.

1.8.1 - Associations
--------------------

* Added API to retrieve associations (PDS-342).


1.5.0 - Extrinsics
------------------

* Remove workaround for registry service emitting HTTP 500 for "not found"
  instead of 404.  (PDS-29)
* Add implementation for ExtrinsicObject in model and in net
* Replaced old "A and B or C" expressions with safer "B if A else C"
  expressions


1.2.0 - Version Updates
-----------------------

This release makes the client API compatible with the 1.2 release of the PDS
registry service.  In particular, it fixes the integration of the
Maven-provided project information with Python's Distribute-supplied project
metadata.


1.0.0 - Released
----------------

This release includes the following changes from the original 
unreleased release:

* The client now works with 1.0.0 of the Registry Service.
* Support for the ``versionID`` attribute in the RegistryObject class is
  dropped as the Registry Service no longer makes that a "user-visible"
  attribute.
