This is an implementation of the ebXML_ Registry information model and client
software, implemented for the NASA_ Planetary Data System (PDS_).

The PDS Registry_ provides tracking, auditing, locating, and maintaining
artifacts within PDS.  These artifacts can range from data files and label
files, schemas, dictionary definitions for objects and elements, services,
etc.

It was developed by the PDS Engineering Node (EN_), operated by JPL_.  See the
package's ``docs`` directory for more information, including installation
instructions, license, and history of changes.
