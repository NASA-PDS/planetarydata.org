2.1.0 — Blue
------------

The spacey theme of the past is out.  A simple, clean blue theme is in.  And
now, we're powered by Diazo.


2.0.1 — Workaround TinyMCE
--------------------------

This release works around some of the problems with TinyMCE.  Notably, the
IPDA theme includes a background image on the html element so it can fill the
entire page regardless of scrolling.  However, the inner html in the TinyMCE
iframe picks that up as well, leaving an ugly navy blue block in your text
editing area.  Secondly, Products.TinyMCE includes a link "Edit without visual
editor" that's contained in a div with a hard-coded style block set to a -1em
margin.  That makes the link land badly in our theme.  Sadly, there's no CSS
classes or IDs we can use on that link (or its div) so we sneak some invisible
content just above it to space it out.  (Ugly yes, but that should be fixed in
Products.TinyMCE.)


2.0.0 — Plone 4
---------------

This release of the IPDA Site Policy brings about Plone 4 compatibility.
